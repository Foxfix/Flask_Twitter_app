# Twitter app

This app works with Twitter API. There's a few steps in order to log in with Twitter.
The first thing is to create a consumer. The consumer is an object which represents our application.
Next is to create a client. The client get the access token.
If user has not yet been created, this app creates user and save it in the database. (Postgresql)
I use Twitter api to retrieve the latest tweets, what I searching.
After that I adding sentiment analysis with another API and noted tweets in different colors.
